    title: "Bridges"
    content: |
      The theme for Inércia 2025 is bridges. Those small and large systems carefully engineered to bring and maintain connectivity.

      Technological bridges, cultural bridges, circuit board bridges, real size bridges, we have a pretty iconic bridge here in Almada that you can also reference if you'd like. Get inspired by bridges and show us what you came up with.

      It's not mandatory to follow this year's theme but you get extra karma points if you do.
