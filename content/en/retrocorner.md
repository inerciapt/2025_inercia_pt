## **Commodore Amiga 500**

The Amiga 500, also known as the A500, was the first popular version of the Amiga home computer. It contains the same Motorola 68000 as the Amiga 1000, as well as the same graphics and sound coprocessors, but is in a smaller case similar to that of the Commodore 128. Released in 1987, the Amiga 500 was the first computer for the home market capable of multitasking. As well, it featured rich color graphics at a time when most high-end computer systems like the Personal Computer and the original Macintosh either had limited color or were entirely monochrome.

## **Macintosh LC III**

The Macintosh LC III was a personal computer designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Computer from February 1993 to February 1994. It was an update to the Macintosh LC II, featuring a faster 25 MHz Motorola 68030 processor and improved graphics capabilities. The LC III was positioned as an affordable machine for education and home users, featuring a compact all-in-one design that could accommodate a standard pizza box form factor.

## **Sinclair ZX Spectrum 128K +2**

The ZX Spectrum +2 has a grey case with a spring-loaded keyboard, dual joystick ports, and an integrated cassette recorder known as the "Datacorder" (akin to the Amstrad CPC 464). 
The boot-up message reads "© 1986 Amstrad". It is largely identical to the ZX Spectrum 128 in most technical aspects.
