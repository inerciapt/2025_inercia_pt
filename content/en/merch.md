The Inércia Demoparty trophies are exclusive to the winners of the demoscene competitions at Inércia. Money can't buy them; you'll need to convince the audience that you deserve one! Design and production by Jae686.

And to protect from the cold, the winners of the Demo competition will take home a handmade scarf with the image of the event. Only a few have been made, so it's best to make sure your demo is the best of all!

{{< singleimage img="/images/stickers-960.jpg" caption="Manuel Correia" alt="Stickers" >}}

Every year we are invaded by various stickers from different visitors, so we made our own! You can get them from the Infodesk but please use them responsibly (don't vandalize the hall or public equipment, just Jeenio's printer!)

### ☕ Inércia Mugs {#mugs}

{{< singleimage img="/images/mugs-960.jpg" caption="Cristina Gaspar" alt="Mugs" >}}

As a freebie to help reduce plastic and paper waste, last year we offered personalized mugs for coffee/water to all our visitors. While we didn't make new ones this year, we still have a few left from last year's batch. If you're quick, you can get one in exchange for a donation before stock runs out. Available at the Infodesk.

### 🧣 Inércia Blankets {#blankets}

{{< singleimage img="/images/blankets-960.jpg" caption="Cristina Gaspar" alt="Blankets" >}}

Last year it got quite cold at night, and this year the forecast isn't much better. There's not much we can do about the thermal insulation of the place, but we can provide some personalized Inércia blankets to keep you warm. They will be available at the Infodesk.
