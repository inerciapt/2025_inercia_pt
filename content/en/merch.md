Missed the In√©rcia 2023 electronic badge? This year, they're back and even better! The 2024 badges now come with a mini OLED screen‚Äîperfect for displaying custom text, animations, and more, plus the ability to play your favorite .mod tunes.

This year, we're excited to increase production to 50 badges, so more of you can get one. Each badge now comes pre-assembled, making it easier to produce in larger quantities than last year.

Badges will be available on a first-come, first-served basis, one per person, to ensure as many participants as possible can enjoy one. Don't miss your chance‚Äîregister to reserve yours using this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdvPtrdOBtuRyJwwf4kTzNnmMbpftY2WMwgaC33z4sE8quB2w/viewform).

Last year we were invaded by stickers from various visitors, so this year we made our own! You can get them at the Infodesk, but please use them responsibly (don't vandalize the venue, public equipment, or Jeenio's printer)!

As a freebie to help reduce plastic and paper waste, last year we offered personalized mugs for coffee/water to all our visitors. While we didn't make new ones this year, we still have a few left from last year's batch. If you're quick, you can get one in exchange for a donation before stock runs out. Available at the Infodesk.

Last year, it got quite cold at night, and this year the forecast isn't much better. There's not much we can do about the venue's insulation, but we can provide some In√©rcia-branded blankets to keep you warm. Available at the Infodesk.
