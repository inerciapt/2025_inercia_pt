## Competitions & Showcases

Do you create art with computers? We want you at InÃ©rcia presenting it! There are several ways to do so, depending on what kind of art you are showing and if you are comfortable with being scrutinized by a public vote. Check these categories to see which one fits your production the best.

 * Combined Demo Competition
 * Fast Themed Demo Competition
 * Size Coding Showcase
 * Graphics Showcase
 * Music Showcase
 * Wild Showcase
 * Live Coding

Also, take some time to get acquainted with our rules.

## General Rules

### Original content

All productions submitted must be original releases of your own copyright and not previously made public. Sampling / remixing to create derivative work of someone else is accepted but within reason, blatant plagiarism has no creative value. When submitting the production please list your sources and tools explicitly, they will be shown on the information slide and are critical to contextualize your entry to the viewers.

### Compo machine specs

OS : Windows 10 (with latest updates)
Chipset : Z790
CPU : Intel 13600K (14C/20T)
RAM : 32GB DDR5-6400MHz
GFX : RTX3080Ti 12GB GDDR6X
Storage : NVME Gen4

If your production targets another platform, please also provide a video recording of it, if you can't do so please come talk with us as soon as possible so we can try to figure out how to capture its signal with acceptable quality.

### Production licenses

All productions entered will be distributed free for download on the internet after the event. By submitting your production to our party website you are agreeing to this distribution. The copyright remains yours ofcourse, and you are free to select what license your work uses, if you prefer something else besides Creative Commons BY-NC-SA that we apply by default. But please be aware your submission will be archived and made public. We might also use your work to promote future editions of InÃ©rcia. Please only submit your entry if you're ok with this.

### Disclaimer

The organization reserves the right to not screen your submission for any reason they see fit, will be enforced in case of productions which are deeemed innapropriately offensive, immoral or illegal according to the Portuguese law.

## Combined Demo Competition

Following our demoscene roots we are holding as our main event the Combined Demo Competition!
It's a competition for executable realtime entries, running on any computer platform made exclusively for InÃ©rcia 2024.

If you're targetting an uncommon platform and/or wish to guarantee we play the demo as it's meant to be shown, please also include a video capture of your entry.

## Live Coding

For the 5th time at InÃ©rcia since it's inception we will be hosting the Shader Royale, with participants locally and a bit from all over the world joining remotely to participate (last year we had 25 participants). You can participate in person at the venue and remotely, you just need latest version of Bonzomatic and to ping psenough or totetmatt on discord for the details on joining. Or check this infopage

Another feature we will have at the party this year will be a TIC-80 wall corner, where any of our visitors can sit for a few minutes and code a visual effect in the TIC-80 environment and then watch it run on a slideshow at the partyplace and later archived on the internet.
