## Competitions & Showcases

Do you create art with computers? We want you at InÃ©rcia presenting it! There are several ways to do so, depending on what kind of art you are showing and if you are comfortable with being scrutinized by a public vote. Check these categories to see which one fits your production the best.

 * [Combined Demo Competition](#combined-demo-competition)
 * [Size Coding Showcase](#size-coding-showcase)
 * [Graphics Showcase](#graphics-showcase)
 * [Music Showcase](#music-showcase)
 * [genAI Showcase](#genai-showcase)
 * [Wild Showcase](#wild-showcase)
 * [Lightning Talks](#lightning-talks)
 * [Shader Royale](#shader-royale)

## General Rules

### Original content

All productions submitted must be original releases of your own copyright and not previously made public. Sampling / remixing to create derivative work of someone else is accepted but within reason, blatant plagiarism has no creative value. When submitting the production please list your sources and tools explicitly, they will be shown on the information slide and are critical to contextualize your entry to the viewers.

Following latest technology developments of AI generative content creation tools, we have adapted this year's regulations to separate the works that were developed heavily relying on these types of tools from our regular competitions and showcases.
Everyone who enjoys exploring genAI technology in all of it's emerging fields can participate instead on the genAI Showcase category, which everyone who despises genAI with a passion can safely ignore.

### Competition machine specifications

OS : Windows 11 (with all latest security updates)
CPU : 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-12700F (2.10 GHz)
RAM : 2x 32GB DDR4-3200
GFX : RTX3060Ti 8GB GDDR6X

If your production targets another platform, please also provide a video recording of it, if you can't do so please come talk with us as soon as possible so we can try to figure out how to capture its signal with acceptable quality.

### Production licenses

All productions entered will be distributed free for download on the internet after the event. By submitting your production to our party website you are agreeing to this distribution. The copyright remains yours ofcourse, and you are free to select what license you prefer for your work if you prefer something else besides Creative Commons BY-NC-SA that we apply by default. But please be aware your submission will be archived and made public. We might also use your work to promote future editions of InÃ©rcia. Please only submit your entry if you're ok with this.

### Disclaimer

The organization reserves the right to not screen your submission for any reason they see fit. This will likely only be enforced in case of productions which are deemed innapropriately offensive, immoral or illegal according to the Portuguese law.

## Combined Demo Competition

Our main event is the Combined Demo Competition. A competition for executable realtime entries, running on any computer platform, as long as they were made exclusively for InÃ©rcia 2025.
If you are not sure what we mean by demo, you might want to [read about the demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) first.

ðŸ“¤ Please submit a zip with your entry: the working binaries of the executable and a short text file explaining what it is, the target platform, the techniques and references used, and how to play it. If you're targetting an uncommon platform and/or wish to guarantee we play the demo as it's meant to be shown, please also include a video capture of your entry.

The winner will be determined by public voting.

## Lightning Talks

We have a new participation format this year to incentivate public sharing and knowledge exchange between our visitors.

Give a lightning talk (less then 15 minutes) about something interesting in your creative digital art process!

It can be something that was developed by you or something you have been exploring lately that you think others will also find interesting. It can be a tool, a production, a work methodology, a source of inspiration, a project you've been working on. Be creative, show us what you been working on and inspire the other visitors. as long as it is remotely related to digital art and computers, it is welcome.

Have an idea but doubts if it makes sense to present it at InÃ©rcia? Get in touch with us through discord and measure it's interest amongst the rest of the community before commiting to it.

ðŸ“¤ Upload a zip file with any slides / video / information about your presentation.

## Shader Royale

For the 5th time at InÃ©rcia since it's inception we will be hosting the Shader Royale, with participants locally and a bit from all over the world joining remotely to participate (last year we had 33 participants). You can participate in person at the venue and remotely, you just need latest version of Bonzomatic and to ping psenough or totetmatt on discord for the details on joining.
