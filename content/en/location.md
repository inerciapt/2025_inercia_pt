## About Almada

Almada is a town on the southern margin of the Tagus river, on the opposite side of the river from Lisbon. It is known for its old shipyard history of Lisnave, the 25 de Abril suspension bridge (similar to San Francisco Bay Bridge) to Lisbon, the ferry boats that bring the two river separated cities together in under 15 mins and the statue of Cristo Rei (similar to Rio de Janeiro statue).

Almada is known as new "hipster" area, just outside Lisbon, perfect for picturesque sightseeing, with many lookouts over the river and a variety of traditional local shops, caf√©s and quality restaurants.

Upon arriving in Lisbon, by plane, train or bus, you could either take the metro or train to Sete Rios, then the train to Pragal and lastly the tram/surface metro to S√£o Jo√£o Baptista, and then walk for 5 minutes.

Another option would be to take the Lisbon metro to Cais do Sodr√©, then take the beautiful boat trip to Cacilhas, and then walk for 15 minutes.
