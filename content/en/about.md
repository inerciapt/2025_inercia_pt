Inércia is organized by [Associação Inércia](https://inercia.pt), a non profit organization dedicated to promoting the demoscene. 2025 will be the 17th edition of Inércia we organize and the fifth taking place in Almada.

Inércia 2025 will take place on the 6th and 7th of December 2025 at Salão Festas Incrível Almadense, the centenary event hall in the heart of Almada, just across the river from Lisbon.

This mythical hall provides us with room for up to 150 visitors (including dedicated table spots with comfortable seating for up to 50 people). The event runs from Friday afternoon until Sunday morning, during which there will be plenty of opportunity to present your work and socialize with other artists, demosceners and hardware tinkerers.

## About the Demoscene

The Demoscene is an international computer art subculture focused on producing so-called demos: self-contained, sometimes extremely small, computer programs that display audiovisual content. The purpose of a demo is to show off programming, visual art, and musical skills.

Demoscene community organizes regular events to compete and socialize called demoparties: physical social events, usually over a weekend, focused on presenting new demoscene content. They typically feature competitions of several categories, seminars about relevant demoscene topics and live performances of music and visuals.

Inércia is a demoparty, but also embraces other digital art cultures, hence being defined as a digital arts and music festival.
