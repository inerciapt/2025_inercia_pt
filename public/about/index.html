<h1 id="about-inérciassssss">About Inérciassssss</h1>
<p>Inércia is organized by Associação Inércia, a non profit organization dedicated to promoting the demoscene. 2024 will be the 16th edition of Inércia we organize and the fifth taking place in Almada.</p>
<p>Inércia 2024 will take place in December 2024, from 6th to the 8th at Salão Festas Incrível Almadense, the centenary event hall in the heart of Almada, just across the river from Lisbon.</p>
<p>This mythical hall provides us with room for up to 150 visitors (including dedicated table spots with comfortable seating for up to 50 people). The event runs from Friday afternoon until Sunday morning, during which there will be plenty of opportunity to present your work and socialize with other artists, demosceners and hardware tinkerers.
What is the event like?</p>
<p>Never visited these kind of events before? Haven&rsquo;t been to one in a while? This is what you can expect:</p>
<p>The focus on Friday is to arrive, claim a spot at one of the tables, unpack your things, get to know everyone and finish your production to be submitted to the party system. Meanwhile we will screen some demos on the bigscreen, hand host a talk or a workshop planned before dinner. After dinner we will host the 4th edition of the Shader Royale, the worlds largest simultaneous livecoding event, where we will have participants from all corners of the world (some sitting in our hall), programming visuals in realtime for our liveact / DJ sets. You are welcome to join in if you know shader coding. To round up the evening program we&rsquo;ll have a live concert of electronic music. Noise curfew on location is at midnight but we are planning an afterparty at a local nightclub with out own DJs at Bar A Cerca.</p>
<p>Saturday morning is typically for finishing your submissions, hear some of our seminar talks or explore the charming Almada downtown.
We will have several events scheduled throughout the day. Competitions and showcases will be later in the afternoon, where participants will have their productions presented on our stage with large screen projection and quality soundsystem. After dinner we will have the highlight of the event: the realtime intro and demo competitions. Noise curfew on location is at midnight but the afterparty at Bar A Cerca will carry on through the night.</p>
<p>Sunday mornings start slowly with some light socializing activities and culminate with the prizegiving / closing ceremony. The doors will close with a community lunch amongst the organizers and remaining visitors, your final opportunity to network.</p>
<p>Video report of Inércia 2023:</p>
<h1 id="about-the-demoscene">About the Demoscene</h1>
<p>The Demoscene is an international computer art subculture focused on producing so-called demos: self-contained, sometimes extremely small, computer programs that display audiovisual content. The purpose of a demo is to show off programming, visual art, and musical skills.</p>
<p>Demoscene community organizes regular events to compete and socialize called demoparties: physical social events, usually over a weekend, focused on presenting new demoscene content. They typically feature competitions of several categories, seminars about relevant demoscene topics and live performances of music and visuals.</p>
<p>Inércia is a demoparty, but also embraces other digital art cultures, hence being defined as a digital arts and music festival.

Ticket Options</p>
<p>Free entrance to our volunteer organizers or associates of Associação Inércia or SFIA with their yearly quotas paid.</p>
<p>Being a member of Associação Inércia costs you 24eur per year, half if you&rsquo;re a student or unemployed. So it&rsquo;s effectively cheaper to become a member and pay the yearly quota then the regular entrance ticket. We want you to become an active member of the association.
€30</p>
<p>Standard Entry</p>
<p>€125</p>
<p>Silver Entry</p>
<p>For those who want to support the party and get all the cool Inércia merchandise.
€250+</p>
<p>Golden Entry</p>
<p>For those who want to support the party at an advertised partner level.
Bring a Buddy</p>
<p>Too expensive? Just curious to check the vibe for little while? Wanted to bring a friend but they are not sure if it&rsquo;s for them? Well, you&rsquo;re in luck! Besides the free entrance on Friday afternoon with a guided tour that we had already announced, we are also now announcing a &ldquo;bring a buddy for a visit&rdquo; system, where each paying member can have a +1 visiting the event for up to one hour. No registration needed, just ask about it at the infodesk. No excuses left not to attend Inércia 2024!</p>
<p>Free entrance to children below 13 years old, accompanied by a responsible adult.</p>
<p>Registration form is closed, but you can still attend the event in person! See you at the party!</p>
<h1 id="rules-of-conduct">Rules of Conduct</h1>
<p>The organization reserves the right to exclude anyone from attending the event that might be causing a disturbance, we do so under the private event house rules law. We will enforce this only when dealing with complaints of discrimination or unwanted indoctrination / rhetoric speech regarding any discriminatory subjects (racism, bygotry, mysogny, religious or political hate speech, conspiracy theories, etc). Any physical or verbal threat / harrassment of our volunteer organizing staff or visitors will not be tolerated. Anyone found breaking Portuguese law will be turned over to local authorities.</p>
